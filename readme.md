🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive maintenance model using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset.
The goal is to analyze machine operating conditions and anticipate potential failures before they occur.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to demonstrate how data-driven insights can help improve industrial reliability and reduce unplanned downtime.

📚 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project originates from:

S. Matzka, "Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Maintenance Applications,"
2020 Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Industries (AI4I), 2020, pp. 69–74.
DOI: 10.1109/AI4I49448.2020.00023

This synthetic dataset is modeled after an industrial milling process and contains 10,000 data points describing various operating conditions and failure modes of a machine tool.
It includes process variables such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear, as well as binary failure labels (machine_failure and five specific failure types).
